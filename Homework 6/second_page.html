	My favorite story: Transformers 2007
        <p>Thousands of years ago, Cybertron was torn apart by civil war between the Autobots, led by Optimus Prime, and the Decepticons, led by Megatron. To protect the Allspark, a powerful artifact, Optimus launched it into space. Megatron pursued the Allspark and crash-landed on Earth, where he was discovered in 1895 by Captain Archibald Witwicky. The coordinates to the Allspark became etched in Witwicky's glasses, which later fell to his great-great-grandson, Sam Witwicky.

In the present day, the Decepticons attack a U.S. military base while searching for the Allspark. A Decepticon named Frenzy hacks military systems, tracking Sam. Meanwhile, Sam buys a Camaro that reveals itself to be the Autobot Bumblebee, who rescues Sam and his crush, Mikaela Banes, from the Decepticons. The Autobots reveal the threat Megatron poses if he obtains the Allspark, prompting a mission to retrieve it.

The situation escalates at Hoover Dam, where Megatron and the Allspark are held. After a chaotic battle in Mission City, Sam ultimately defeats Megatron by using the Allspark against him. With the government dismantling Sector Seven, Sam and Mikaela start a romantic relationship, while Optimus sends out a signal to other Autobots. The film concludes with a glimpse of Starscream escaping into space.</p>
