A GUI or Graphical User Interface allows users to directly interact with the system visually, often featuring buttons, icons and windows. GUI's differ from CLI's (Command-line Interface) in the sense that CLI's require users to directly input commands to interact with the system. This grants more control over the system and allows for more complex tasks in a faster speed. CLI's are less intuitive however, users must know the commands to be able to do what they want.
